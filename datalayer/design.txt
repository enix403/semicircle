==================

Store Balance
-------------
One time: Store has an initial balance along with the day it started. Does not change once set

* Store Opening Balance = <something>

Retail Items
------------

A tangible item.

Metadata:
    Name

Pricing Info
    Sell price (very dynamic, changes often)

Quantity:
    Each items needs to be "quantified" in order to sell it and keep in sync with the inventory (below)

    Selling units can be *wildly* different than both inventory units AND supplied units from suppliers

    Countable: 1, 2, 3, ...
    Uncountable: <some float> kg

Raw Items
---------

Same as Retail Items, but not for sale. These are items for self packaging

Self Packaged Items
-------------------

Same as retail items with respect to sales. Difference comes in supplies and inventory managements. COUNTABLE only

There needs to be a process that converts Raw Items (or maybe any item ??) to these Self Packaged Items
    Source Item A
    Target Item B

    A <=> B -> dA, dB
    A -= dA
    B -= dB

Service
-------

Basic difference b/w this and other items is that services' amounts get paid AFTER their successful completion, usually after a few days  

There is currently only one service [regarding "wheat"]. It is as follows:

    Customer provides wheat suppose X kg
    Store initiats a tranform to floor
    After a few days it is complete (store person comes and marks it complete)
    Some amount Y kg just disappears as misc wastage during the process
    Customer gets (X - Y) kg of FLOOR (different item) in return, but pays a full price of X kg

    Another variant with additional "cleaning" of customer wheat. This has higher price and incurs more wastage


Sales
-----

    Checkout
    --------
        This creates a cart
        A cart is a combination of 0 or more of the following
            |- Retai Item
            |- Self Packaged Item
            |- Services

        Each element of items will specify a quantity, to deduce (only in case of items) from the inventory
        

    Payment
    -------
        Once a cart has been finalized, the customer needs chooses either direct cash payment or add the sale amount
        to his store credit. For this the customer needs to be an approved and registered one beforehand by the store.

Customers
---------

Small scale loan system.

Have an opening credit amount

Customer walks in. A complete checkout cycle takes place. But for payment, the customer delays the it according to their convenience.

The funds are not received. For the time being store is in loss.

They can come in anytime and clear the pending funds

They can "pile up" funds over the time from multiple sales and every now and then come and initiate a clearance

They can perform a normal payed sale too, irrespective of his pending funds. I.e Checkout \/ Payment.
[x]Payment can be partial, in which case, remaining funds would be added to the total pending funds[x]
Payment in this case cannot be partial. Either full sale amount or nothing

* Payment -> Pending | Completed

Inventory / Stock
-----------------
Stores "how much" of each item is there

Inventory stores only the normalized quantity regardless of packs

One of:
    a) a high precision all float number
    b) a pair of integers
        |- 1st element stores the actual integral part
        |- 2nd element stores the fractional part in some "subunit"
        For example 2.75 kg would be stored as (2kg, 750g)
    c) single integer storing a smaller non-fractional subunit
        For example 2.75 kg would be stored as 2750g


Supplies
--------

A supplier can be a permanent or one-time/anoynomous

Items list for supplies are similar to a sale cart. Items supplied can be as single untis or in "packs"
Packs:
    1 box of 6 units of rio chocolate
    4 sack of 20 kg of wheat
    3 containers of 12 lt of oil
    2 cartons of 15 units of coke bottle

[x]You can have different packs of same items in a single order[x]

Instead of directly updating the stock, a buy order is issued against a particular supplier with the above info 
with the amount paid for it. After a few days the order is marked as delivered and inventory is updated

Some suppliers also deliver extra units as "gifts" in a buy order. BUT this is mentioned at the time of order delivering.

60 kg of wheat
2 units of coke bottle
